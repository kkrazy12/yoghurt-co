                <p>Here at Yogan we create exquisite vegan yoghurts and desserts. We recently opened here in Plymouth, a
                    small city
                    in England. Rain or shine, Plymouth, Britain's Ocean City is home to breath-taking views, plenty to
                    see and do and lots of fresh,
                    sea air. Our customers visit regularly and we are open to their feedback and requests. We feel at
                    home here and want you to aswell!

                    <br><br>The vegan lifestyle is very important to us for multiple reasons. If you want to read more
                    about the benefits of the lifestyle,
                    please view our vegan lifestyle page. Our main priority is that our customers are satisfied with
                    their dessert and know exactly
                    where it has come from and how it was made. We use all natural ingreidents and cooking processes to
                    ensure the desserts are the healthiest
                    we can make them. </br>

                    <br>Our speciality is our wide range of yoghurts available to collect or deliver. We don't know of
                    any other vegan yoghurt companies,
                    and hope we can prove to you how great vegan yoghurts can taste. When you purchase a yoghurt, you
                    will receive the dessert in fully recyclable
                    pots and materials because we care deeply about our enivronment. </br>
                </p>

                <p>Not only do we sell yoghurts here at Yogan, but we have many different desserts and hot beverages our
                    customers can choose from.
                    We appreciate that it can be difficult to find vegan alternatives for the foods you love and here at
                    Yogan, we want you to feel at home.
                    <br><br>To cater for those who do not want to spend too much money on vegan catering services, we
                    have created our own at a fair price. Come
                    and visit us for a taster session ready for your big event. We understand how stressful arranging
                    things like this can be, so we have a
                    dedicated page you can view for more information. </br>
