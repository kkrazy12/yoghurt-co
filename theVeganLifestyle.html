        <p>Research shows that we could feed an additional 4 billion humans if we grew our crops directly for human consumption, rather than feeding the crops to farmed animals and then consuming them.
            Fortunately, veganism can save our oceans! Animal agriculture causes ocean dead zones due to overfishing, pollution and climate change which is ruining marine ecosystems. Scientists expect fishless oceans by 2048 unless we change the animal food industries and their practices.

        <p>Doctors all over the world are recommending their patients to limit their consumption of red meat and processed meat in order to reduce their risk of diseases. Animal products have been linked to various health issues such as heart disease and hypertension, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, kidney disease, and various cancers.

            It’s been shown that the correlation between animal products and cancer is as strong as the link between tobacco and cancer. </p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Veganism is defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose.
                For these reasons, the vegan diet is devoid of all animal products, including meat, eggs and dairy.</p>
                People choose to follow a vegan diet for various reasons.
                These usually range from ethics to environmental concerns, but they can also stem from a desire to improve health.
                BOTTOM LINE:
                <p>A vegan diet excludes all animal products. Many people choose to eat this way for ethical, environmental or health reasons.</p>

                <p>Vegan diets are linked to an array of other health benefits, including benefits for:</p>

                    Cancer risk: Vegans may benefit from a 15% lower risk of developing or dying from cancer (20Trusted Source).
                    Arthritis: Vegan diets seem particularly effective at reducing symptoms of arthritis such as pain, joint swelling and morning stiffness (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
                    Kidney function: Diabetics who substitute meat for plant protein may reduce their risk of poor kidney function (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
                    Alzheimer’s disease: Observational studies show that aspects of the vegan diet may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).
                    That said, keep in mind that most of the studies supporting these benefits are observational. This makes it difficult to determine whether the vegan diet directly caused the benefits.
                    
                    Randomized controlled studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.</p>
