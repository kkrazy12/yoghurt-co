            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Veganism is defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose.
                For these reasons, the vegan diet is devoid of all animal products, including meat, eggs and dairy.</p>
                People choose to follow a vegan diet for various reasons.
                These usually range from ethics to environmental concerns, but they can also stem from a desire to improve health.
                BOTTOM LINE:
                <p>A vegan diet excludes all animal products. Many people choose to eat this way for ethical, environmental or health reasons.</p>

                <p>Vegan diets are linked to an array of other health benefits, including benefits for:</p>

                    Cancer risk: Vegans may benefit from a 15% lower risk of developing or dying from cancer (20Trusted Source).
                    Arthritis: Vegan diets seem particularly effective at reducing symptoms of arthritis such as pain, joint swelling and morning stiffness (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
                    Kidney function: Diabetics who substitute meat for plant protein may reduce their risk of poor kidney function (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
                    Alzheimer’s disease: Observational studies show that aspects of the vegan diet may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).
                    That said, keep in mind that most of the studies supporting these benefits are observational. This makes it difficult to determine whether the vegan diet directly caused the benefits.
                    
                    Randomized controlled studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.</p>
